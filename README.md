## Mail 2 Diaspora

Small piece of code providing a way to post text and image to Diaspora via
emails. It depends on [SRMail](https://github.com/kianby/srmail) to manage
e-mails. Other dependencies are available via **Pip** and they are described in
**requirements.txt**. Mail2Diaspora is written in Python 3.

Look at self-documented **config.json** to know more.
