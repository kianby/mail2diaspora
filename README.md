## Mail to Diaspora

Small piece of code providing a way to post text and image to Diaspora via
emails. It is part of my ecosystem built around RabbitMQ. It depends on
[SRMail](https://github.com/kianby/srmail) to send and receive e-mails. Other
dependencies are listed in **requirements.txt**. Mail2Diaspora is written in
Python 3.

**config.json** is a configuration example.
